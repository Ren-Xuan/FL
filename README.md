#### Run Code:

python main_fed.py --iid   --gpu 0 --local_ep 5 --local_bs 10  --num_users 1024 --frac 0.1 --dataset [fashionmnist/cifar/agnews]  --model [cnn/resnet/lstm] --epochs 250 [--fedslice]

num_users represents the number of edge devices

- **'num_users'**  represents the total number of edge devices 
- **'frac'** represents  the proportion of edge devices participating in the training each epoch
- This parameter **'fedslice'** means that the FedSlice algorithm is used; without this parameter, the FedAvg algorithm is used.

#### Note: 

#### 		The federated learning environment in our code is simulated by a single server, not a real federated cluster.

#### 	Code implementation of the main Federated Learning structure modified from: https://github.com/shaoxiongji/federated-learning.
